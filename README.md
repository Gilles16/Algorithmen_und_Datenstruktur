# Tree Data Structures in C++

This repository provides an implementation of various **tree data structures** in C++, including basic binary trees, binary search trees (BST), and self-balancing trees like AVL trees. The goal of this project is to help understand and utilize tree-based algorithms and their applications.

## 📋 Features

- **Binary Tree**: Basic structure with in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal.
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: Efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations.
- **AVL Tree**: Self-balancing binary search tree for optimal performance.
- **Visual Representation**: Display tree structures in a readable format.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- A C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC).
- CMake (optional, for building the project).
